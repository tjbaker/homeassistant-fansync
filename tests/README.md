## Tests for Home Assistant FanSync Integration

This directory contains the test suite for the FanSync custom integration. The suite focuses on setup UX, error handling, optimistic updates, reconnect paths, and detailed debug logging.

### Quick start

```bash
# Create a virtualenv (first time)
python3.13 -m venv venv

# Activate the repo's virtualenv (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip and install dev requirements
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run all tests
pytest -q

# Run with coverage (target â‰¥ 75% for custom_components/fansync)
pytest --cov=custom_components/fansync --cov-report=term-missing

# Type check
mypy custom_components/fansync --check-untyped-defs

# Lint and format checks
ruff check
black --check .
```

### Guidelines

- **No real network calls**: Patch HTTP/WebSocket at the integration module paths.
  - Patch `httpx`/client calls at: `custom_components.fansync.client.*`
  - Patch WebSocket/threading where applicable at: `custom_components.fansync.client.*`
- **Home Assistant helpers**: Use HA test helpers for flows and entries.
  - Config flow: `hass.config_entries.flow.async_init(...)`
  - Avoid directly instantiating flow classes in tests.
- **Cleanup background work**: Ensure background threads/tasks are stopped.
  - Always call `await client.async_disconnect()` in tests that create a client.
- **Debug logging**: Prefer `caplog` to assert log content and levels.
  - Example:
    ```python
    import logging

    caplog.set_level(logging.DEBUG, logger="custom_components.fansync")
    ```
- **Coverage focus**: Emphasize paths in `custom_components/fansync`.
  - Include tests for: push callback merge, reconnect paths, config flow
    (happy/error/duplicate), optimistic overlay expiry, multi-device isolation,
    and debug logging of significant events.
- **Type safety**: Keep `--check-untyped-defs` clean for the integration package.
- **Ruff/Black**: Keep the codebase clean and consistently formatted.

### Useful fixtures and patterns

- `ensure_fansync_importable` (fixture): Ensures the custom component is importable
  in test environments without leaking global sys.path or sys.modules mutations.
  Use it in tests that exercise config flows.

- `caplog`: Assert structured debug logging without depending on exact timings.

- `AsyncMock`/`MagicMock`: Use `AsyncMock` for coroutine attributes like
  `async_connect` and `async_disconnect`; ensure you `await` them.

### Logging assertions

Prefer verifying that key diagnostic messages are present instead of asserting
exact timings or sleep durations. For example, assert that reconnect attempts,
backoff steps, token refresh, and overlay expiry messages appear at
`logging.DEBUG` when applicable.

### Adding new tests

When adding functionality:
- Provide tests that demonstrate behavior and error handling.
- Include debug logging assertions where logs provide diagnostic value.
- Ensure background tasks are cleaned up.
- Keep commits Conventional (e.g., `test: add coverage for options flow`).

### Troubleshooting

- If a config flow test cannot import the custom component in isolation, use the
  `ensure_fansync_importable` fixture. In full-suite runs, Home Assistant's test
  harness typically provides the necessary environment automatically.
