# Cursor Code Style Rules for this repository

# General
- Follow PEP 8 for Python style.
- Optimize for clarity and readability; prefer explicit types where helpful.

# Formatting
- Use Black-compatible formatting.
- Maximum line length: 100.
- Target Python version: 3.13.

# Imports
- Organize imports consistent with Ruff isort settings.
  - known-first-party: ["fansync", "custom_components"]
  - Do not force single-line imports.

# Linting (mirror pyproject Ruff rules)
- Enable Ruff rules: [E, F, I, B, UP].
- Respect per-file ignores from pyproject:
  - tests/**/*.py: [E501, F401, I001]
  - examples/**/*.py: [E501, F401, F403, B904]
  - fansync/**/*.py: [E501, F401, F403]

# Home Assistant specifics
- Use HA async patterns (`async_*` methods); avoid blocking I/O in the event loop.
- Prefer CoordinatorEntity for entities with push updates.

# Comments
- Keep comments concise and only when adding non-obvious context.

# Do not introduce unrelated style changes beyond these rules.
