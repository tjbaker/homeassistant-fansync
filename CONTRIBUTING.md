# Contributing to Home Assistant FanSync

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Community pull requests and issues are very welcome.

## Code of conduct

- Be respectful and constructive. Assume good intent. We aim for a welcoming and inclusive
  environment for all contributors.

## How to contribute

- Open an issue (with logs)
  - Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, propose features, or ask questions.
  - Include clear steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and a concise log slice.
  - During initial login (config flow), enable HTTP stack logging so auth errors/timeouts are visible.
    - Developer Tools → Services → `logger.set_level` → Data:
      ```yaml
      httpcore: debug
      httpx: debug
      custom_components.fansync: debug
      ```
    - Reproduce the problem, then restore defaults via `logger.set_default_level` (or restart).
    - Persistent alternative (advanced): add to `configuration.yaml` and restart:
      ```yaml
      logger:
        default: info
        logs:
          httpcore: debug
          httpx: debug
          custom_components.fansync: debug
      ```
    - Include:
      - HTTP POST to FanSync session endpoint and response/timeout lines (`httpcore`/`httpx`).
      - After setup: messages from `custom_components.fansync.*` (connect/login timings, reconnects, status updates).
    - Redact sensitive data (email, tokens, IPs) before sharing.
  - Home Assistant docs: https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#enabling-debug-logging

- Submit a pull request (PR)
  - Small, focused PRs are easier to review and merge.
  - Reference any related issue(s) in the PR description (e.g., "Fixes #123").
  - Follow Conventional Commits for PR titles (e.g., feat, fix, docs).

## Development

### Guidelines

- Coding style: Black + Ruff, Python 3.13, modern typing.
- Home Assistant specifics: async patterns, CoordinatorEntity, push-first updates.
- Tests: pytest with no real network calls; coverage enforced in CI.
- Single canonical AI instruction file: `.cursorrules` in repo root (pre-commit syncs it to other locations). Edit only `.cursorrules`.

### Setup

```bash
# Create and activate a virtualenv
python3.13 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install tools
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Lint/format
ruff --fix .
black .
```

### Pre-commit

This repository uses pre-commit to enforce style and commit message conventions.

Hooks configured (see `.pre-commit-config.yaml`):
- ruff (with `--fix`) and ruff-format
- black (line length 100)
- sync ai instructions (keeps `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in sync with `.cursorrules`)
- commitizen check (runs at `commit-msg` stage; enforces Conventional Commits and ≤ 72-char subject)

Install and enable hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

Run hooks manually on all files:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Update hook versions:
```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

### Commit conventions

- Use Conventional Commits for PR titles and commit subjects: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
- Keep subject ≤ 72 characters.

### Testing and type checking

- See `tests/README.md` for test suite details and patterns.
- Common commands:

```bash
pytest -q --cov=custom_components/fansync
mypy custom_components/fansync --check-untyped-defs
ruff check
black --check .
```

 

## AI assistant guidance

- The canonical rules live in `.cursorrules`. A pre-commit hook syncs content to other locations.
- Edit only `.cursorrules`; do not hand-edit generated copies.

## Getting help

- If you’re unsure how to implement something or where it belongs, open an issue first and we’ll
  discuss the approach together.

Thanks again for helping improve this integration!
